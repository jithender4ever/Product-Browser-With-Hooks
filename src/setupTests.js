/**
 * The following code (hack) was added to remove the following warning
 * 
 *     Warning: An update to ProductBrowser inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).
 *     ...
 * 
 * A quote from Kent C. Dodds on getting the following warning
 * (quote taken from https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library/issues/281):
 * 
 * Ok so here's the scoop: If you want to get rid of the warnings
 * upgrade to react-dom@16.9.0-alpha.0 or wait until react-dom@16.9.0
 * is stably released, and then upgrade. It may be a few weeks before
 * 16.9.0 is actually released, so keep that in mind.
 *
 * If you don't want to upgrade, but still want to silence the warnings
 * for now, then you can add the following code to your setupTests.js file.
 * Then you can remove that when you do upgrade.

// this is just a little hack to silence a warning that we'll get until react
